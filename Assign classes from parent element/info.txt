I wanted to create a easy way to make many elements get classes assigned and removed based on the visibility of the parent element, or in simple terms: I wanted elements to style different in base to the visibility of where they were placed on the page. That's how I came out with that solution, I think it was really cool and would have worked if it wasnt for the fact that the parent element was too big and the child elements were styled way earlier of what I needed. still, I think it was a cool idea. :)
